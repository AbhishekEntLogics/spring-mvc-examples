Spring MVC
==========

This code base supports latest Spring 4.1.7.RELEASE version.

In this sample, we demonstrated a simple Bookstoree application using Spring MVC, [Kickstrap](http://ajkochanowicz.github.com/Kickstrap/). It demonstrate how to build a Spring MVC application using a TDD approach.

Refer to this [blog](http://krishnasblog.com/2013/02/22/junit-testing-of-spring-mvc-application-introduction/) for more details.

We have implemented new [Spring Boot tutorial](https://github.com/skprasadu/spring-mvc-examples/tree/master/bookstore-spring-boot) in the same format.
